# OEDEMA-DETECTION-IN-FLAIR-MRI-SCANS-THROUGH-ENHANCED-IMAGE-PROCESSING-AND-ANALYSIS-TECHNIQUES

This project explores a structured, convolution-like approach to digital image processing,
focusing on the enhancement of MRI scans in NIfTI format. The process is predicated on the
sequential character of a convolutional network, where the output of one layer acts as the input to
the next one, thereby iteratively processing the image. After that, the display and loading of the
3D medical images for both quantitative analysis of the geometry of the images as well as for the
feature discovery will take place. Based on Python tools, central slices of the MRI volume are
extracted and displayed to form a straightforward environment for further modification.

In this method, percentile-based intensity rescaling - one more processing
step in the overall process of brightness normalization and enhanced visibility of clinically
relevant anatomical structures - contributes to better visualization of low-contrast structures.
Through the use of specific intensity sets, contrast stretching can highlight regions that are not
specifically defined as being well visualized in the standard image.

Contrast enhancement followed by unsharp masking technique is applied. In doing so edges and
boundaries are privileged and structures which may be clinically relevant are brought into light.
Initially, gaussian blur is performed on image, and then discriminable variations between the
original image and the blurred image are aggregated to highlight the characteristic image
features. Unsharp masking output emphasizes the salient information and clarifies the delineated
edges of anatomical structures such that they become more evident and more easily identifiable.
To improve the control of the output a second contrast streaking stage is applied. At the same
time the embedded features can be clearly identified and so a satisfactory sharpness and quality
of the final image can be provided, e.g. Specifically, the sequential incorporation of these
processing schemes resembles the processing pipeline of a convolutional neural network and the
output of each processing step is dependent upon the information that has been extracted in the
previous stage.

Applications of this technique are presented by means comparison, i.e. The presented work
provides an example of how classes of image processing algorithms can be applied in order to
generate very detailed and interpretable images from input raw MRI data. These cycles of
process optimization are having a profound impact on clinical and scientific application. Higher
quality in medical imaging has created a gateway to improved visual exploration and, ultimately,
to higher diagnostic accuracy and research production. As the process shows it is possible to
re-interpret a research-based medical image database applying a framework-based method within
the context of convolutional-based method for medical image processing, the present study
provides a certain procedure for the re-construction of research-based medical image databases.
